# static_comp

### Abstract
Spent eight hours working on this static comp project. We were proveded a layout and were expected to stick to the layout itself, but were able to be creative with our theme, colors, and images. I found this project to be so fun, I loved getting to mess with accessability and getting to bring some interests into the project as well.
